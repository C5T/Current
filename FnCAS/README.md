# `FnCAS`

FnCAS, originally stands for "FnCAS is not a Computer Algebra System", is a fast and easy-to-use wrapper for gradient-descent-based optimization of convex functions. The speed is achieved by JIT-compilation of the function and its gradient, and the ease of use comes from automated analytical differnetiation.

More README to come soon. Sample code and examples can be found at:

* The [unit test](https://github.com/C5T/Current/blob/master/FnCAS/test.cc).
* An [end-to-end optimization example](https://github.com/C5T/Current/blob/master/examples/Optimize/optimize.cc).
