"Good to have"-s and "didn't-have-time-to-add"-s, in no particular order.

* Hash of function. Use it in source / library file name. Don't regenerate / recompile same function.
* Variable policies during optimization (ex. this var should always be positive).
* Variable adjustment policies (ex. normalize this exp-normal simples to average of zero).
* Return `PointAndValue` from a compiled function-plus-gradient (now returns only the gradient)?
* Consider `as` (`gcc X.s`) instead of `nasm`. Or LLVM.
* Consider self-modifying code too.
* Tests for unary plus/minus.
