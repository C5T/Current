## Visualization Library

Bricks has C++ bindings for [`gnuplot`](http://www.gnuplot.info/), [`#include "bricks/graph/gnuplot.h"`](https://github.com/Current/C5T/blob/stable/bricks/graph/gnuplot.h) to use it.

External [`gnuplot`](http://www.gnuplot.info/) binary is invoked. The requirement is that it should be installed in the system and accessible in the `$PATH`.
