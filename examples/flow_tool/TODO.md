- [ ] Implement basic file system GET.
- [ ] Implement basic file system PUT.
- [ ] Implement basic file system DELETE.
- [ ] Implement basic file system rename (via PATCH, I'd assume).
- [ ] The directory listing endpoint should return metadata; at least if some entry is a file or another dir.
- [ ] Make sure the origin header is set correctly for cross-domain browser-originated requests.
- [ ] Only allow alphanumeric characters in file names so far.
- [ ] Directories should require a slash at the end, files should not.
- [ ] File versioning, and looking at different versions.
- [ ] The value of the blob should be a strong variant type, that can be `#define`-d externally.
- [ ] The namespace should also come from a `#define`, to enable more than one `FlowTool` header per binary.
- [ ] HTML output, and move the `Accept: text/html` part into `blocks/http`.
- [ ] Add some static HTML (`base64` would do for now. -- D.K.).
- [ ] Add a standalone tool along with the unit test.
- [ ] Persistence and starting from a snapshot.
- [ ] Users and authentication.
- [ ] Auth in transaction meta fields.
- [ ] Access permissions.
- [ ] Custom validation (server-side).
- [ ] Custom actions per file type (more browser-side).
- [ ] Export into certain directory (maybe even dynamically, with a unit test using some temporary subdirectory).
