# Signing the [CLA](https://github.com/C5T/Current/blob/master/contributors/CLA.md)

To ensure Current lives long and prospers, having an MIT license is not enough. While we'd love to have your code in Current, your CLA is an essential prerequisite for it to happen.

**TL;DR**: To make sure your code is an asset, not a liabilitity, for Current as we move forward, we need you to certify the code you contribute is your own, or at least can be treated as such.

To sign the CLA, [read it](https://github.com/C5T/Current/blob/master/contributors/CLA.md), confirm it doesn't contradict your religion, and create a pull request with a single Markdown file, containing a confirmation you accept the CLA.

Please:

* Call this Markdown file `{your_github_handle}.md`.
* Placed it under the `contributors/signed/` directory.
* Have it contain:
  * Your name.
  * Date.
  * The "I hereby agree" clause.
  * The declaration you're authorized to sign the CLA.
  * The version of the CLA you're signing (GitHub commit hash is OK).

Wait until we merge your pull request, and we're good to go.

Thanks!
Current Maintainers
