* Tell categorical fields.
* Detect "double as string" and "integer as string" fields.
* Detect "Optional<value> as string" fields (ex. all numbers as string, and a few "N/A"-s.)
* Add the conversion tool in addition to the inference one (ex. convert numbers into strings, and categorical values into CURRENT_ENUM-s.)
