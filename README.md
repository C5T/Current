## Contribution

Welcome, contributors! Please [start here by signing the CLA](https://github.com/C5T/Current/blob/stable/contributors/README.md).

## Quick Start

### Install the development dependencies

- `nasm` for `FnCAS`.
  - **macOS**: `brew install nasm`
- `geninfo` from `lcov` for coverage report.
  - **macOS**: `brew install lcov`
- `clang-format-10` for code formatting (`make indent`).
  - TODO(dkorolev) On **macOS** no `clang-format-3.6` was availably, and the trick was to use `clang-format-3.8` and symlink it: `brew install clang-format@3.8 && ln -s /usr/local/bin/clang-format-3.6 /usr/local/opt/clang-format@3.8/bin/clang-format`, double-checking.

### Clean the output of the previous builds

```
make clean
```

### Run the tests

Builds and runs all the tests as a single binary. Slow, eats up tons of CPU, but measures coverage.
Consider `make individual_tests` or `make test` within individual directories to run the subset of tests.
```
make test
```

Builds and runs the tests for each module separately:
```
make individual_tests
```

Builds and runs the tests for one of the modules (e.g. `blocks/http`):
```
(cd blocks/http && make test)
```

### Verify the code

"Builds" all header files individually, twice each header file, and "links" these pairs together.
Ensures no symbols are exported, and the ODR will not be violated when linking together two objects, each of which is independently using Current.
```
make check
```
