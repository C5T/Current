## Current::HTML

Please do not use this code.

This is not the right way to generate HTML from C++.

In fact, HTML should never be generated from C++.

C++-based HTML code generators are all terrible hacks, and this piece of code is no exception.

Seriously, if you are considering using this code, chances are, you are doing something very, very wrong.

... more disclaimers ...

And you do want to hack something up quickly, please refer to the unit test. You're welcome.
